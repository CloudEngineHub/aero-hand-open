# Aero Hand Hardware

## CAD 
- CAD files are provided in step format for the right and left hand.
- We have also uploaded all CAD to [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/afc7e0ca7eb6d412ec8771f8/w/bc4d7e45e17e23d622d2bad2/e/1e3862db4d4df7d9dca6f286?renderMode=0&uiState=68e5abd64106f26dc459da44). There is a motion study in the OnShape workspace, please do not refer to this CAD to build you hand, it is **NOT** up to date.
- A one click print file is provided for both right and left hands, the print orientations have been optimized to minimize supports and we reccomend keeping them the same. Printed on Bambu Labs X1C with 0.4mm nozzle, default print settings for 0.20mm standard layer height except: enable tree supports and supports only on build plate.
- Silicone mold files are also provided as step files and one click print files.

## Electronics
**Option 1:** Daisy chain the servos together with a 3 cable junction provided with each servo. Note that the wires are **not** rated for the max current all 7 motors could draw. It is very challenging to fit all wires/connectors/controllers in the hand using the daisy chain method.

**Option 2:** Solder a protoboard with molex connectors so that all the wires can fit within the palm. Depending on how you wire this it may be able to handle the max current. 

**Option 3:** We are designing a custom PCB that will house everything in the hand. Schematics, layout and manufacturing files will be uploaded soon.

## Assembly
- Please refer to the Assembly Instructions pdf to assemble the hand, we are always working to improve the assembly instructions and appreciate any feedback. A video assembly will be released soon.
- The BOM is provided and a list of tools to help with assembly is also provided.
- Silicone mold instructions are provided, a TPU alternative will also be available coming soon
