## Hardware Overview

The hand adopts a **tendon-driven actuation architecture**, where each motor drives multiple joints through cable routing.  
This approach achieves high dexterity with fewer actuators, resulting in a lightweight and compliant design.

**Key characteristics:**
- 16 Degrees of Freedom (7 active, 9 passive)
- 3 active DoFs for the thumb, enabling real dexterity
- One-motor-per-finger tendon actuation
- Passive 1:1 coupling between DIP and PIP joints
- Adaptive coupling at MCP joint for compliant contact behavior
- Compact servo actuator modules with integrated encoders
- Modular 3D-printable mechanical components
