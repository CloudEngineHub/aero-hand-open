# Aero Hand Open — Licensing Guide

_Last updated: 2025‑10‑16 — This document is for clarity and does not replace the legal text of the licenses. It is not legal advice._

## What’s covered by which license?

- **Software (firmware & SDK)** — licensed under **Apache‑2.0**.
- **Hardware design files & documentation** (CAD/STEP/STL, drawings, BOM, assembly/build guides) — licensed under **CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0**.
- **Physical Aero Hand units you purchase** — governed by our **Terms of Sale** plus the **Commercial Integration Permission** below.

> **Plain English:** CC BY‑NC‑SA applies to our **hardware files and docs** (how you can use/share/modify them). It does **not** restrict what you do with a **physical unit** you bought from us. Apache‑2.0 covers the software.

---

## Commercial Integration Permission (for purchased units)

To make integration easy and unambiguous:

**If you lawfully purchase physical Aero Hand units from TetherIA or an authorized reseller, TetherIA grants you a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free permission to:**
1. **Incorporate those units** (including necessary mounts, wiring, and calibration) into products and services you commercialize;
2. **Market, distribute, and support** products that include those units; and
3. **Use and redistribute our firmware/SDK** as permitted by **Apache‑2.0** (including required notices).

**This permission does _not_ grant:**
- any right to **manufacture hands or parts from our design files** for commercial purposes;
- any right to **commercialize derivatives** of our design files (including 3D‑printed spares, kits, or modified hands made from our files);
- any license to **TetherIA trademarks** beyond fair use, or any **patent rights**.

---

## CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0 (for design files & docs)

- **Attribution:** credit TetherIA when you share the files or derivatives.
- **NonCommercial:** you **may not** use the files (or derivatives) for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
- **ShareAlike:** if you share modified files, you must license them under **CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0** as well.

**Commercial manufacturing from our design files** (including printing parts for sale, producing kits, or selling assembled hands made from our CAD) **requires a Commercial Manufacturing License** from TetherIA (see below).

---

## Apache‑2.0 (for firmware & SDK)

- Commercial use, modification, and distribution are allowed, with the usual **notice** and **license** requirements.
- If you modify the code, keep the required headers and notices.
